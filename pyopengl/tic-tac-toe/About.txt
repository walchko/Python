This variant of 3D tic tac toe was developed by me, Ian Mallett, and a friend of mine while we were supposed to be paying attention in Complex Analysis.

The goal is to get four in a row in any direction (except vertically).  

The four boards are projective, so pieces *project* through all four layers of the board.  Pieces project upwards and downwards, but only as far as they aren't "blocked" by the other player's pieces.

The boards may also be modular (see settings.py).  If this is the case, then solutions may wrap around boards, including in projection.

See the in-game tutorial for more clarification.

Note that the game will not necessarily consider the "most obvious" solution first when evaluating the board for an end state, although the fewer projections the more favored the solution.
