vCard
======

This program creates a QR code for vCard. A QR code image can hold only about 1200 bites of information. Although, this can be a lot of characters, it is not enough to encode a useful image but you can link to an image on the inter-web.

make_qr.py takes a vcard and encodes it into a QR code image. 

make_vcard.py creates a vCard.
